# *About me*

Hello, and welcome to my Reading Notes section. My name is Zach Winterton, I am currently enrolled with Codefellows in pursuit of becoming a software developer. I like to fish, take care of my pet fish and enjoy time with my wife and dog. This is where I will store all my notes as I continue my journey with codefellows.
