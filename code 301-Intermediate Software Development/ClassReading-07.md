## How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding?
He helped write the first web servers and then went on to explain why the web works the way it does. 

### Why don't the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
The techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to eachother didn't need to talk to all of the machines, only a small group. 

### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
It is about applying verbs to nouns. Examples are the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

### What does a GET do?
For a system to retrieve information from eachother.

### What does a POST do?
If a system needs to add something to another system.

### What does PUT do?
If a system wants to replace something in another system.

### What does PATCH do?
It will do a partial update to system.

### What is node used for?
It allows us to run JavaScript on the server. Can also help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server. It plays a critical role in the technology stack of many high profile companies.
