# React and Forms

## React Docs-Forms

### What is a 'Controlled Component'?
"single source of truth" the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in that way is called a Controlled Component.

### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
We should wait to store the users responses from the form into the state when they submit the form because they may have made a mistake.

### Why do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
Maybe you need to handle multiple controlled input elements. You could add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do.



## The conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

### Why would we use a ternary operator?
To shorten our lines of code up to potentially one line, instead of multiple. It could be much faster. Saving time

### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
if(x===y){
  cosole.log(true);
}else{
  console.log(false);
}

Statement rewritten as a ternary statement:

x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
