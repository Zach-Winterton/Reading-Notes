## An introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com

### What is Node.js?
It is an event-based, non-blocking, asychronous I/O runtime that uses Google's v8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

### In your own words, what is chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine?
It was built by Google and it is used in Google's chrome or other chrome based browsers. It was designed to perform well and to compile JavaScript directly, code that your computer can execute.

### What does it mean that node is a JavaScrirpt runtime?
Refers to where your JavaScript code is executed when you run it. Browser wise.

### What is npm?
A package manager for JavaScript also the world's largest software registry. It has over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download.

### What version of node are you running on your machine?
I am running version v14.17.2

### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
I am running npm version 6.14.13

### What command would you type to install a library/package called 'jshint'?
You would type in npm install -g jshint into your terminal.

### What is node used for?
It allows us to run JavaScript on the server. Can also help you implement a cloning strategy on a single server. It plays a critical role in the technology stack of many high profile companies.

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
<ul>
<li>Greater Efficiency</li>
<li>Engaged Collaboration</li>
<li>Learning from fellow students</li>
<li>Social Skills</li>
<li>Job Interview Readiness</li>
<li>Work Environment Readiness</li>
</ul>

### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
I've found that it does have greater efficiency. During 201 final projects, that is what my group did. There was four of us and we broke of into two teams. It seemed to work very well. We were able to get a lot of code done fairly quickly and there wasn't hardly any mistakes or git problems. Communication was always there. I don't believe we would of had as much success as we did if all four of us went off and did seperate things/tasks.

### How does pair programming work?
It is the pratice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. Two heads are better then one. One person is the driver while the other is the navigator. The navigator thinks about the big picture while the driver implements the code on the computer screen.
