## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

### What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
Personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers. They were marketed to primarily men and boys.

### Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
The narrative that computers are for boys became a thing. So girls didn't grow up playing on computers but boys did. So when they eventually went to college men studied computer science while women pursued other careers.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company


### When are diversity efforts most successful?
They are most successful when driven by a commitment from company leaders.

### Why do diverse companies perform better?
Because they have diverse teams. Which are smarter and more creative. Which inreturn has positive financial outcomes for said companies. They are able to come up with different ideas/solutions and think of them faster.

### Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
When a company has diversity it is able to think about potentially all of its user base. There wants, there needs, etc. For example a lot of people are right handed. So if you build a product for only right handed people you alienate left handed people. You also lose out on extracting there money as a company. That's not good business. You want to be able to extract money from everyone equally
