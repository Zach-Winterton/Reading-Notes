## NoSQL vs SQL

### five differences between SQL and NoSQL Database
<ul>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Has schemas</li>
<li>Has Relations</li>
<li>Uses tables for data</li>
<li>Vertical scaling, as in more horsepower for computer</li>
<li>Has limitations for lots of read and write queries</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>NoSQL</li>
<li>No schemas</li>
<li>Has very few if any Relations</li>
<li>Uses collections for data</li>
<li>Horizontal scaling, as in more servers</li>
<li>Works well with lots of read and write requests</li>
</ul>


### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
If your data is highly structured, and if it needs to be updated or changed frequently

### Give areal world example.
If you opened up a small online store that doesn't get a considerable amount of traffic then you would want to go with an SQL database

### What kind of data is a good fit for a NoSQL database?
If you have a very large amount of data that is unstructured or semi structured.

### Give a real world example.
If you needed to support a large number of concurrent users. Like if you were an international hotel business that handles a lot of reservations then a NoSQL database would work best.


### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSqL database fits better for hierarchical data storage

### Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL databases are horizonatally scalable, so you just have to add a few more servers for larger traffic

## SQL vs NoSQL


### What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language

### What is a realational database?
A database that works a certain way, 

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?
It works with tables

### What is a 'schema'?
It is a format in which all records have to follow it for consistency.

### What is a NoSQL database?
Built to store lots of data in an efficient way, it has lower consistency of information.

### How does it work?
It has no schema and very few relations. It stores the data in documents

### What is inside of a mongo database?
Documents which are gathered together in collections. It stores one or more collections. Data could be semi to unstructured.

### Which is more flexible SQL or MongoDB? and why.
Mongo DB is more flexible. You can scale it by adding more servers, its less structured as in schema less, few relations. But both have there strong points and weak points and should be used accordingly.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Having to update or having data that changes a lot would be a disadvantage for a NoSQL database because it may get sluggish or not work properly.
